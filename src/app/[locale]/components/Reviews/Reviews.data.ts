    beef tartare, both delicious. The menu had great choice and the prices are fair/affordable, very good price for the quality. The ambience was great, 
    very cosy and quiet. Roman, our waiter/bartender was very friendly and efficient. We will visit again!

    The jukebox is the key, so many songs, ridiculously cheap and you have full control of the music. I can't stress enough how much you'll enjoy yourself just chatting and 
    rocking out to your favorite musical artists while here.`,
